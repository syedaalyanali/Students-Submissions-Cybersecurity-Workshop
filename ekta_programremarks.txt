How it can be exploited:
Untrusted pickle data can execute arbitrary code during deserialization — an attacker-supplied payload can run commands on the server, leading to remote code execution.

Remediation:
Avoid pickle.loads on untrusted data. Use safe formats (JSON) or strict deserialization libraries that enforce types. If binary deserialization is required, use a safe, allow-list approach or sandboxed processing.
