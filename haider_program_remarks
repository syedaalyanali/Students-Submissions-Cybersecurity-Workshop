How it can be exploited:
Attackers craft links to this site that redirect victims to malicious pages (e.g., https://trusted.app/go?next=https://evil.example) — victims trust the initial domain and click, then get sent to phishing pages.

Remediation:
Validate the next parameter against a whitelist of allowed hosts or only accept relative paths. Use an internal redirect route that checks targets and refuses external domains.
